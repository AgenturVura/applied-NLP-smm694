Scope
=====

For the **FCP** ― to be launched in week 6 ―, students are supposed:

1.  to prepare and analyze a real-world dataset containing
    press-releases, business reports, and financial analysts reports
    (all relevant will be made available in week 5);

2.  to use the main insights emerging from 1) to analyze the performance
    of British, publicly-listed companies in the aftermath of the 2016
    Brexit Referendum. A group of publicly listed companies based in
    France and Germany will offer the counterfactual data to estimate
    how British companies could have performed in case of no-leave.

FCP submissions will be evaluated on a rolling-based window and are due
by July 17 (8:00 PM London Time).
