Extra-session on sentiment analysis
===================================

Business problem
================

+ product-market categories are essential infrastructures of markets
  - a 'category' is a socially-shared label
    * when people use the label 'Italian cuisine' they agree, to a certain
      extent about what constitutes an Italian dish
  + a 'category' is a recognizable type of product, i.e., a distinctive set 
    of features

Why do product-market categories matter?
========================================

+ producers appreciate competitive ties based on cognitive categories
    (e.g., Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, 1989)
+ consumers infer the unknown quality of an offering based on the fit
    with a category
+ categories facilitate the interaction between producers and consumers (they
    act as interfaces) 

Category-spanning penalty
==========================

+ an offering that is associated with multiple categories tends to be devalued
+ there are two mechanisms in place:
  - lack of expertise: consumers don't buy producers master multiple skills or 
    credibly combine diverse knowledge bases
  + confusion in evaluation: assuming expertises are not problem, consumers lack
    clear reference points to evaluate 'weird' offerings
