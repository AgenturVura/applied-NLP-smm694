# Week 1, problem set

Here's the problem set due on May 26 (5:00 PM):

Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh9wM846bMA based on the
insights emerging from the video, describe an NLP project that you'd like to
carry out using the Reddit corpus (the scope of the project should be relevant
from a business/economic/organizational perspective) There are no particular
requirements for the format of the document: both PowerPoint alike presentations
and short essays are accepted (what's important is that you convey your ideas
effectively and efficiently).

Let me stress that you can work on the problem set on your own or with your
teammates.
