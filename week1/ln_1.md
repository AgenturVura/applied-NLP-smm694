### Week 1, Intro to NLP

# Overview of NLP: Agenda

+ conceptual and methodological roots
+ scope of application
+ established tools
+ hot topics

---

# Conceptual and methodological roots

+ (computational) linguistics: it offers the theory and analytical frameworks to understand and represent natural language

+ computer science: it offers the infrastructure to encode and manipulate natural language data

+ ML/DL: it offers the tools to discover the linguistic properties (e.g., semantics) of text corpora at a scale

# Scope of application

+ NLP is a vast and fragmented field of research and practice that could confuse newbies

+ Let's try to make order/sense by grouping NLP applications into two categories:

    - operational applications
    
    - strategic application

---

# Operational applications

For example:

+ text summarization
+ classification
+ speech recognition and synthesis
+ dialogue systems and chatbots
+ question answering
+ text translation
+ phonetics

---

# Strategic applications

For example:

+ language modeling
+ vector semantics and embeddings 
+ topic modeling
+ sentiment analysis
+ information extraction

---

# Gamut of NLP tools & SMM694

+ operational applications are close to the world of software engineering

+ SMM694 focuses on the class of strategic applications of NLP, which are closer to the community of computational linguists and data scientists
