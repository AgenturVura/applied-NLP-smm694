# Mid-term project

## Description

Word vectors convey valuable information about apical individuals,
organizations, and collectives. However, business and financial analysts seldom
use embeddings. This could be due to the fact that word vectors― contrarily to
topic modeling ― don't offer any recipes to analyze a corpus of text; instead,
word vectors are ingredients every analyst has to combine creatively in order
to create her/his own recipe.
 
For this mid-term project, groups are required to assess the state of the art
of embeddings in fields such as insurance, finance, economic research and
policy, strategic management, marketing, or organizational behavior/leadership.
At minimum, five (5) applications from the above-mentioned fields should be
retrieved. Working papers, published papers, and white papers/industry reports
count as applications; blog posts don't.

The assignment has two components:

+ Part A: for each application, the students should highlight:
    + the role of embedding
    + the added value of embeddings _vis a' vis_ alternative NLP tools, especially,
      topic modeling
    + how embeddings have been applied (from a methodological/technical/software 
      point of view).
+ Part B: the students are required to elaborate on one possible application
of word embeddings they would like to work on in the future to solve some
concrete economic or organizational problems.
    
## Deliverables

By June 18 (8:00 PM), groups have to upload the following set of
 materials:

+ a PowerPoint or LaTeX presentation (including the bibliography) 
  covering part A. No limit applies in terms of words/number of slides
+ a Markdown or LaTeX, 600-word document covering part B.
