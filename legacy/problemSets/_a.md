# Problem set A

Consider the press data included in tutorial [_0][1]. Using spaCy:

1. Pass the entire corpus of text (circa 4,300 articles) through an NLP pipeline (use 
   the `en_core_web_lg` model of the English language to do that)
2. How many unique entities of 'ORG' type are present in the entire corpus of text?
3. The corpus of text spans several years â€• in other words, it's a panel. How many 
   unique entities of 'ORG' type are present in each year of the panel?
