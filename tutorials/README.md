# Tutorials ― README

## Overview

Below is the set of tutorials students may want to go through to fix some core 
ideas discussed in the online videos/tutorials. The large majority of tutorials
also offer some basic NLP recipes that may be useful for future projects.
(I'll continue to update this as the module progresses; keep an eye on it.)

## Learning goals of the individual tutorials

The following sections provide a concise description of each tutorial's learning
goals.
### Tutorial `0` ― textual data preparation and transformation

Learning goals:

1. familiarizing with the functioning of spaCy's NLP pipeline
2. expanding on the default set of stopwords included in spaCy
3. using Gensim to create and store the dictionary and corpus out of a
collection of documents

### Tutorial `1` ― manipulating word vectors with NumPy and SciPy

Learning goals:

1. expanding on the features included in word embeddings
2. assigning a specific role to technical and scientific computation libraries
   in the context of NLP
3. calculating similarity metrics with SciPy 

### Tutorial `2` ― browsing word embeddings

Learning goals:

1. browsing word embeddings to sample clusters of words that are semantically
   similar
2. visualizing clusters of words that are semantically similar

### Tutorial `3` ― visual exploration of word embeddings' features

Learning goals:

1. charting the semantic relations involving sets of lexical items
2. familiarizing with dedicated libraries for the visualization of word embeddings

### Tutorial `4` ― analogical reasoning with word embeddings

Learning goals:

1. expanding on word embeddings to uncover complex semantic relations involving 
   lexical items

### Tutorial `5` ― using word embeddings as features for ML models

Learning goals:

1. using word embeddings as features in a regression framework
2. picking-up the most suited regression framework to exploit the predictive
   value of word embeddings
